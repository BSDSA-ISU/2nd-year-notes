# Hallo there 👋🙂

Welcome to my reviewer repository — the digital equivalent of a sleep-deprived brain dump before exams.  
You’re here. I’m here. None of us know why. But congratulations anyway.

## 📚 What even is this repo?

This repo is basically a chaotic pile of reviewer notes turned into Markdown files because:

- PDFs are annoying  
- Word files are worse  
- My attention span is illegal in 42 countries  

Markdown is clean, readable, and doesn’t try to fight me every time I press Enter. So yeah. That’s why everything is `.md`.

## 🛠 How I make these

My highly sophisticated workflow:

1. Open module  
2. Copy content  
3. Paste  
4. Pretend I understand it  
5. Add formatting so it looks like I understand it  

That’s it. No magic. No productivity guru nonsense. Just raw academic survival instinct.

## 😐 Do I enjoy making these?

Short answer: **No.**

Long answer:  
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

I make these out of necessity, not passion. If studying were optional, this repo would not exist and I’d be doing literally anything else, like staring at a wall or optimizing my desktop for the 900th time.

## 🤡 Why does this exist then?

Because future me is forgetful as hell and will absolutely panic before exams.

This repo is basically a time capsule from:
> “Past me who suffered”  
to  
> “Future me who will suffer again”

You’re welcome, future me. You ungrateful goblin.

## ⚠️ Warning

Contents may include:

- questionable explanations  
- sleep-deprived formatting decisions  
- random sarcasm  
- aggressive note-taking energy  

Accuracy not guaranteed. Emotional damage guaranteed.

## 📌 Final Notes

If you're reading this expecting professionalism…

you took a wrong turn somewhere.

This repo exists purely for survival, not aesthetics.  
If it helps you too, cool. If not, skill issue.

> **Conclusion:**  
> This README is longer than some of my study sessions.  
> That says a lot about both this file and my discipline.
