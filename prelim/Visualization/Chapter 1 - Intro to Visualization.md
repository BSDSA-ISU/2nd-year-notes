## What Is Data Visualization?

**Data visualization** is the process of communicating and translating data and information in a visual context, usually employing a graph, chart, bar, or other visual aid. Visualization also uses images to communicate the relationships between various sets of data.

Data visualization is also called information visualization, information graphics, and statistical graphics. It is a step in the process of data science, which tells us that after all data has been collected, processed, and modeled, the information must be visualized so that users can use it to draw conclusions.

- Translates complex data into visual form
- Supports interpretation and decision-making
- A critical step in the data science process after data collection and analysis

## History of Data Visualization

### Pre-17th Century: Early maps and diagrams

Prior to the 17th century, data visualization existed mainly in the realm of maps, displaying land markers, cities, roads, and resources. Maps were essential tools for explorers, merchants, and governments, as they provided critical information for navigation, trade, and territorial claims.

Among the earliest graphical depictions of quantitative information is an anonymous 10th century multiple time-series graph of the changing position of the seven most prominent heavenly bodies over space and time.

### The 17th Century: The Dawn of Statistical Visualization

The 17th century marked the dawn of statistical visualization, a pivotal moment when the representation of abstract data began to take shape. In 1644, Michael Florent Van Langren, a Flemish astronomer, is believed to have provided the first visual representation of statistical data. This marked a significant shift from purely geographical maps to the visualization of abstract data.

### The 18th Century: The Rise of Thematic Mapping

The rise of thematic mapping in the 18th century marked a significant evolution in the field of cartography and data visualization. This era introduced maps that went beyond merely depicting geographical features, focusing instead on specific themes such as population density, economic activity, and health statistics.

The 18th century saw the beginning of thematic mapping. Thematic maps differ from traditional maps in that they focus on specific themes or topics, such as population density, economic activity, or health statistics, rather than geographic features. Attempts at the thematic mapping of geologic, economic, and medical data were made near the end of the century.

#### William Playfair: The Father of Modern Statistical Graphs

This period also gave us William Playfair, who is widely considered to be the inventor of many of the most popular graphs we use today, including line, bar, circle, and pie charts. Playfair’s work was groundbreaking because it introduced the concept of visualizing economic and social data to reveal trends and patterns that were not immediately apparent in numerical form.

Many statistical chart types, including histograms, time series plots, contour plots, scatterplots,
and others were invented during this period.

### The 19th Century: The Golden Age of Statistical Graphics

The latter half of the 19th century is what Friendly calls the Golden Age of statistical graphics. This era was marked by significant advancements in both the theory and practice of data visualization.

#### John Snow and the Cholera Map

John Snow’s map of cholera outbreaks in the London epidemic of 1854. This map was revolutionary in its ability to identify the source of the cholera outbreak, demonstrating the power of data visualization in public health.

#### Charles Minard’s Chart of Napoleon’s Russian Campaign

Another iconic visualization is Charles Minard’s 1869 chart showing the number of men in Napoleon’s 1812 infamous Russian campaign army, with army location indicated by the X-axis, and extreme cold temperatures indicated at points when frostbite took a fatal toll. This visualization is celebrated for its ability to convey multiple dimensions of data in a single, powerful image.

### 1900-1950: The Modern Dark Ages of Data Visualization

The “Modern Dark Ages” of data visualization was a period where the progress in developing new visualization techniques slowed, largely due to the statistical community’s preference for precision over interpretative visual methods.

There were few graphical innovations, and, by the mid-1930s, the enthusiasm for visualization which characterized the late 1800s had been supplanted by the rise of quantification and formal, often statistical, models in the social sciences. Numbers, parameter estimates, and, especially, those with standard errors were precise.

### The Late 20th Century: The Computer Age

The latter half of the 20th century is what Friendly calls the ‘rebirth of data visualization,’ brought on by the emergence of computer processing. Computers gave statisticians the ability to collect and store data in increasingly larger volumes, as well as the ability to visualize the information quickly and easily.

### Pioneers of Modern Data Visualization

The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of researchers like John W. Tukey in the United States and Jacques Bertin in France, who developed the science of information visualization in the areas of statistics and cartography, respectively. Their contributions laid the groundwork for modern data visualization techniques, which integrate statistical rigor with the power of visual communication.

## Importane of data visualization

### Data Visualization Simplifies the Complex Data

Large and complex data sets can be challenging to understand. Data visualization helps break down complex information into simpler, visual formats making it easier for the audience to grasp.

### Enhances Data Interpretation

Visualization highlights patterns, trends, and correlations in data that might be missed in raw data form. This enhanced interpretation helps in making informed decisions.

### Data Visualization Saves Time

It is faster to gather some insights from the data using data visualization rather than just studying a chart.

### Improves Communication

Visual representations of data make it easier to share findings with others especially those who may not have a technical background. This is important in business where stakeholders need to understand data-driven insights quickly.

### Data Visualization Tells a Data Story

Data visualization is also a medium to tell a data story to the viewers. The visualization can be used to present the data facts in an easy-to-understand form while telling a story and leading the viewers to an inevitable conclusion. This data story should have a good beginning, a basic plot, and an ending that it is leading towards.

## Principles of Effective Data Visualization

### Clarity and Simplicity

**Clarity** in data visualization refers to making sure the audience can easily understand and interpret the data being presented.

**Simplicity** in data visualization is about removing unnecessary elements and focusing only on the essential components that contribute to understanding the data.

Here’s why prioritizing these elements is essential:

- Enhanced Comprehension
- Effective Communication
- Increased Engagement

### Tips for Achieving Clarity and Simplicity

- **Minimize Clutter**: Remove any elements that do not contribute to understanding the data. This includes excessive labels, grid lines, and colors.
- **Use Clear Labels and Legends**: Ensure that all labels are easy to read and understand. Legends should be concise and placed close to the related data.
- **Limit Your Color Palette**: Too many colors can confuse and distract. Use color deliberately to highlight significant data points or to group related items.
- **Focus on One Main Message**: Each visualization should convey a single key insight. If you have multiple messages, consider using multiple charts.

### Choose the Right Chart Type

The choice of chart impacts how well the data’s story is understood and can be the difference between clarity and confusion. Different chart types are suited for different kinds of data and analytical purposes:

### Guidelines for Selecting the Right Chart Type

- **Identify Your Goal**: Decide whether you’re comparing values, showing a distribution, illustrating a relationship between variables, or demonstrating a composition of data.
- **Consider Your Data**: The nature of your data (categorical, time series, continuous, etc.) will influence the most effective way to visualize it.
- **Simplicity is Key**: Choose the simplest chart that accomplishes your goal. Overly complex charts can confuse your audience.

### Color Usage

The strategic use of color in data visualization can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the presented data, aiding in differentiation, emphasis, and emotional impact.

However, improper use of color can just as easily detract from the data, leading to confusion, misinterpretation, and a visually unappealing presentation.

#### The Role of Color in Data Visualization

- Differentiation: Color helps in distinguishing between different data sets or categories within a visualization, making it easier for the audience to follow and understand distinct parts of the data.
- Emphasis: Using color strategically can draw attention to key data points, outliers, or areas of interest, guiding the viewer’s focus to important insights.
- Aesthetic Appeal: Color adds visual interest and can make data visualizations more engaging and memorable to the audience.
- Emotional Influence: Colors can evoke emotions and influence perception, which can be leveraged to highlight urgency, trends, or relevance of the data presented.

#### Guidelines for Choosing Color Schemes

- **Use Contrasting Colors for Clarity**

  - Contrast helps in distinguishing different elements in the visualization. For instance, use contrasting colors for the background and foreground to ensure legibility

#### Common Color Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overuse of Colors**: Using too many colors can create a chaotic and confusing visualization that’s hard to decode.
- **Ignoring Cultural Contexts**: Colors have different meanings in different cultures. Ensure your color choices do not convey unintended messages to a global audience.
- **Lack of Consistency**: Using colors inconsistently across multiple visualizations can confuse the audience. Maintain the same color schemes across related charts for continuity and easier comparison.
